# Rusticle - A Custom Language Interpreter in Rust for Lin

Welcome to Rusticle, the programming language that combines the elegance of Rust with the simplicity of a popsicle! Whether you're declaring variables, writing functions, or importing packages, Rusticle makes it a breeze. Just like a popsicle on a hot day, Rusticle is refreshing and easy to enjoy. So grab your favorite flavor, dive into the code, and let the cool syntax of Rusticle chill your programming woes away!

P.S.: The entire vibe syntax should work flawlessly... except for while loops. Why? Well, somewhere between my brilliant ideas and their execution, I managed to break them. Oh, and don’t even try package installation—it’s as broken as my hopes of loading the module correctly. Both of these hiccups exist because I messed up in multiple places. Think of it as a feature: you get to admire my creativity in breaking things!
